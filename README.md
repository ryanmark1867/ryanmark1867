I'm currently working on repos for an upcoming Manning book on machine learning (gradient boosting and deep learning) with tabular data.

I've created "hello world" examples that work in Colab for the follwoing deep learning with tabular data stacks:
- [TabNet on PyTorch](https://github.com/ryanmark1867/tabnet_basics)
- [fastai](https://github.com/ryanmark1867/fastai_basics)
- [Ligthning Flash](https://github.com/ryanmark1867/lightning_flash_basics)
- [Keras](https://github.com/ryanmark1867/deep_learning_basics)

And I'd be interested to get "hello world" examples working for the following deep learning with tabular data stacks:
- TabNet on TensorFlow
- DeepTables
- SAINT
- PyTorch Tabular
